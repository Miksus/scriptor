## What is it?
Scriptor is a high-level library for command-line.
Scriptor makes it easy to integrate other CLI programs to your Python application.

Core features:

- Run programs sync or async using same syntax
- High-level program abstraction
- Easy program parametrization

Install it from PyPI:

```shell
pip install scriptor
```

## Why Scriptor?

Scriptor abstracts ``subprocess`` and ``asyncio.subprocess``
to the same syntax making it easy to use both of them and 
switch between.  

## More Examples

There is also a query language for arbitrary search queries:

```python
>>> from scriptor import Program
>>> python = Program("python")

>>> # Call the program (and wait for finish)
>>> python("myscript.py")
```

Same with async:

```python
>>> from scriptor import Program
>>> python = Program("python")

>>> # Call the program (and wait for finish)
>>> await python.call_async("myscript.py")
```
